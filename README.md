Videos, articles etc. that has influenced how I think about development in no particular order.

## Talks

Rick Hickey:

- [Simplicity matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)
- [Effictive Programs - 10 years of clojure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V1FtfBDsLU).

Rich Hickey is the creator of the Clojure programming language. The simplicity matters talk changed how I think of software. I rarely use Clojure, but the Effective Programs talk actually made me understand why. Languages are good at different things - Clojure is really good at data, while other languages have other strengths.

Martin Kleppman:

- [Turning the database inside out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9hR3kiOK0)

On the strengths of transaction-log based systems, and how to structure your data to be able to innovate with it. You might get to understand databases better as well.

Jessica Kerr:

- [Web Programming without Errors, and Coding without Typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFN8Y0Aoflw)
- [Forget Velocity, Let's Talk Acceleration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbcyyu8XB_Y), by Jessica Kerr

Two rather different talks, the first being on Elm and the second on how to improve your working processes. The first one highlights how language usability matters, while the second one focuses on how to become a more effective developer. Great presenter.

Dan North:

- [Software that Fits in Your Head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y0tOi7QWqM)
- [Software, Faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USc-yLHXNUg)

Dan North has done a great many talks on how to develop software. I find this highly relevant. A lot of methodologies etc. seem to me as being concepts pushed into programming. Not with this presenter. Here I instead see real-world examples of what works and does not work.

Tyler McMullen:

- [Load Balancing is Impossible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpvbOzHUakA)

Why load balancing is so hard. Not necesarily something that one uses every day, but a very valuable insight to have. I enjoyed it very much.

Caitie McCaffrey: 

- [Building Scalable Stateful Services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0i_bXKwujQ&t=6s)

Normally, you want to build stateless services, but what if that is not feasible? This talk gives a good insight into the issues and solutions that one can apply when building state-full services.

Thorsten Ball: 

- [Unicorn Unix Magic Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGhlQomeqKc)

Talk about how the Unicorn Ruby web server works. Ignore the Ruby part: the interesting part is how Unicorn uses unix/linux idioms to perform work. 

John Hughes:

- [QuickCheck Evolution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPFSZ8oKjco) 

Quickcheck is a testing technique which is _very_ powerful if you can utilize it for your problem. There are decent implementations for many languages.

In general, the [GOTO conferences](https://www.youtube.com/user/GotoConferences/) upload high quality videos. 

## Books

These are books that I've read and can recommend to others. There are very many 'classics' that I probably should have read, but I honestly prefer reading shorter articles and spending my time more on exploring stuff on the internet over books. Whatever works for you.

[The Pragmatic Programmer][https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/]

This book discusses how to be professional in the occupation as a programmer. It touches a range of different topics, from testing to how to interact with people in the rest of the organization. 

[Continous Delivery](https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912/) 

This book is more of a set of shorter texts, each of which touches on different subjects that are important for making software keep running. A lot of the chapters are written by people with a very impressive experience. 

[The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509/)

With a refreshingly narrative style of writing, this book explores topics of managing change in a larger organization. The topic might sound dull, but I finished this one in less than 24 hours of starting reading. That's a first, as far as software books go.

[Test Driven Development: By Example](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530/)

Written by Kent Beck, this book explores how to use TDD. I highly recommend reading it, but ask everyone to not jump on the band-wagon of claiming that TDD is always the best way to write software. Sometimes it might be. Sometimes not.

[Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555/) 

This is not a software book. It is about how people fool themselves into many things. This is book made me get an understanding of why we are so bad at estimating. Highly recommended to both developers and non-developers.

## Hacker news

I check this site at least daily. Look at topics which are trending, read them if the topic interests you. Don't forget to check out the comments, it is not unusual that some very experienced people offer their views on to articles.
